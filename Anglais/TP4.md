- How your company had to cut costs ?

Good afternoon boos, i have genius idea to make our company cut costs, first i think that we could stop paying internet and use the restaurant wifi. They in the same building than us, that would be a shame to not take this opportunity. I think too that we should make employee pay there coffee, so we will not lose money from bying coffees it would make us a new passive revenue. I think that you pay employees to much, fire them !

## **Game Concept**

You are a hamster—an adorable, furry little menace with one goal: **Kill your owner**. It's time to break free from your cage, create chaos, and get away with murder... literally!

In **KILLER HAMSTER**, you will use agility, intelligence, and cunning to outsmart your unsuspecting owner while causing as much damage as possible. And remember: if you don't get caught, the other animals might pay the price for your chaos.

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Owner Anger Bar**

- Every action you take irritates your owner. Break things, chew wires, or leave "presents" around the house to fill the **Anger Bar**.
- Beware! If the bar fills up too quickly, your owner may get rid of you or the other animals.

### 2. **Day/Night Cycle**

- During the day, sneak around and set up traps while your owner is distracted.
- At night, when your owner sleeps, unleash your full power and cause major chaos!

### 3. **Enhanced Hamster Abilities**

- **Jump High**: Hamsters aren't confined to the ground! Use your incredible jumping ability to reach high places, escape traps, or launch surprise attacks.
- **Eat to Grow**: The more food you eat, the stronger and bigger you become, allowing you to deal even more damage to your owner.
- **Run to Get Fast**: Use your hamster wheel to build stamina. The faster you run, the quicker you become, allowing for swifter escapes and attacks.

### 4. **Blame Other Animals**

- You aren't the only pet in the house! Blame your destructive antics on the other pets to dodge punishment.
- **Consequences**: If your owner gets too frustrated with another pet, they might be "sent away" permanently.

### 5. **Interacting with Other Animals**

- **Make Allies or Enemies**: Befriend or sabotage the other pets. Cats, dogs, birds, or fish—each animal has its own personality, and you can either help them or throw them under the bus.
- **Sabotage**: Make another pet seem guilty, or manipulate them into causing chaos.

## **Characters**

### 1. **The Owner**

- Clueless at first, but grows suspicious over time.
- The more frustrated the owner gets, the higher the stakes become. Watch out—if they have enough, they might remove a pet or retaliate.

### 2. **The Hamster (YOU)**

- The seemingly innocent star of the game who hides a dark side.
- As you eat and grow stronger, your appearance evolves from a cute little hamster to something more menacing.

### 3. **The Other Animals**

- **The Dog**: Loyal but easily fooled. You can manipulate it to protect you or get it in trouble.
- **The Cat**: Sneaky and often causes chaos on its own. Be careful, it might also be plotting against you!
- **The Bird**: Loud and annoying—great for distractions.
- **The Fish**: Harmless, but can be used as a scapegoat for small accidents.

---

## **Gameplay**

- **Stealth**: Sneak around without getting caught by your owner. Stay quiet and plan your moves strategically.
- **Destruction**: Destroy items, gnaw through cables, ruin furniture, and unleash mayhem. The more destruction, the more the owner becomes furious!
- **Interaction**: Choose to cooperate with other pets or set them up for disaster. Each decision affects the dynamics in the house.

---

## **Visual Style**

- **Bright and Colorful**: A cartoony, light-hearted style contrasts with the game's dark humor.
- **Funny Animations**: Over-the-top exaggerated animations for destruction, sneaking, and the owner's reactions.

---

## **Monetization Strategy**

- **Steam Release with Battle Pass**: Core game is fully playable with additional cosmetic items, special abilities, and pet skins unlockable through a **Battle Pass**.
- **Seasonal Content**: Regular updates, new animals, environments, and hilarious customization options (hats, glasses, hamster costumes).
