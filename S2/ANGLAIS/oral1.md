**Jimmy (asking for advice)**
Hi Arthur, I just started my new job in an *open space* office, and I don’t really know how to behave. Do you have any advice?

**Arthur (giving advice)**
Of course! First, don’t bring smelly food. If you put something strong in the *fridge*, everyone will complain!

**Jimmy**
Oh… I was planning to bring fish tomorrow.

**Arthur**
Bad idea! Also, try to *get on with* your *neighbours*. Be friendly and make some *small talk*, but don’t *disturb* them too much when they are working.

**Jimmy**
So I shouldn’t talk all the time?

**Arthur**
Exactly. And don’t stick to your phone. If you need it, use your computer instead.

**Jimmy**
Okay, that makes sense.

**Arthur**
Another important thing: take a *break* during the day. If you work too much without resting, you could have a *burnout*.

**Jimmy**
Wow, I definitely don’t want that.

**Arthur**
And don’t forget your *posture*. Sit straight at your desk. In ten years, your back will thank you!

**Jimmy**
Good point!

**Arthur**
Also, don’t stare or *gaze* at people’s screens. It’s not polite.

**Jimmy**
Oops… I sometimes do that.

**Arthur**
And finally, don’t dress like it’s Sunday. A polo shirt and jeans are perfect.

**Jimmy**
Thanks, Arthur! Now I feel ready for my new job!

**Arthur**
You’re welcome! Good luck in your open space office!
