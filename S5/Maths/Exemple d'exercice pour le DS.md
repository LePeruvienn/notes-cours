## 1) Justify a priori that the matrix is diagonalizable with an orthonormal basis


$$
^tA = A
$$
So A is symmetric 
Thus, A is diagonalizable in an orthonormal basis

## 2) Compute the characteristic polynomial of A

Let's call it Pa the characteristic polynomial of A
Pa(X) = det(A-XI2)

$$
P_{A} = det() 
= (2-X)(2-X) - 1*1
= 4-4X + X² - 1
= X² - 4X + 3
$$

## 3) Deduce the eigenvalues of A



## 4) find the eigenspaces


## 5) Diagonalize A with an orthonormal basis, i.e., find a diagonal matrix D and an orthogonal matrix P such that A = PDP^-1
